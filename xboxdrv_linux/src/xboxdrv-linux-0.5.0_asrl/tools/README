[[ Tools ]]
===========

This directory contains jstest and evtest. You can sometimes find
these tools in your distribution, but especially evtest can sometimes
be hard to come by, so I have included them here for convenience.

usbcat is a little tool to dump content from a usb device, it is just
for debugging and reverse engineering of the USB protocol of a device.

You can compile them via:

 % scons


# EOF #
