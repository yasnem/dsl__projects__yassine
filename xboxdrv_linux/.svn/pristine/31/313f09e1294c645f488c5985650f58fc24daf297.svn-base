[[ Xbox/Xbox360 USB Gamepad Driver for Userspace ]]
===================================================

This is a Xbox/Xbox360 gamepad driver for Linux that works in
userspace. It is an alternative to the xpad kernel driver and has
support for Xbox1 gamepads, Xbox360 USB gamepads and Xbox360 wireless
gamepads. The Xbox360 guitar and some Xbox1 dancemats might work too.
The Xbox 360 racing wheel is not supported, but shouldn't be to hard
to add if somebody is interested.

The Xbox360 chatpad does currently not work and the headset does
neither. There has been some work on reverse enginiering, but no
usable results.

This driver is only of interest if the xpad kernel driver doesn't work
for you or if you want more configurabity. If the xpad kernel driver
works for you there is no need to try this driver.

Newest version of the driver can be found at:

 * http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/

The development version can be optained via:

 * git clone http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv.git


[[ Compilation ]]
-----------------

Required libraries and tools:

 * g++ - GNU C++ Compiler
 * libusb
 * boost
 * scons
 * uinput (userspace input kernel module)
 * git (only to download the development version)
 * X11
 * python-dbus (for xboxdrv-daemon.py)

Once everything installed, you can compile by typing:

 % scons

On Ubuntu 10.04 you can install all the required libraries via:

 % sudo apt-get install \
     g++ \
     libboost1.40-dev \
     libboost-thread1.40-dev \
     scons \
     libusb-dev \
     git-core \
     libx11-dev \
     x11proto-core-dev \
     python-dbus

To load the uinput kernel module automatically on boot add it
/etc/modules, to load it manually type:

 % sudo modprobe uinput

On other distributions exact install instructions might be
slightly different.


[[ Installation ]]
------------------

Once the compilation process is complete you can install xboxdrv with:

 % ./install.sh

You can change the install prefix with:

 % ./install.sh --prefix /usr

Note that there is no need to install xboxdrv, you can run it directly
from the source directory if you prefer.


[[ Running ]]
-------------

Extensive documentation on running xboxdrv can be found in the RUNNING
XBOXDRV section of the xboxdrv manpage. When you haven't installed
xboxdrv the man page can be found in doc/xboxdrv.1 and be read with:

 % man -l doc/xboxdrv.1

Documentation on xboxdrv-daemon, a daemon that will automatically
launch xboxdrv when a pad is plugged in can be read via:

 % man -l doc/xboxdrv-daemon.1
